Update line 87 from `rgba(255, 255, 255, ${snowflake.opacity})` to `rgba(255, 0, 0, ${snowflake.opacity})` for the center color. Update line 88 from `rgba(240, 245, 255, ${snowflake.opacity * 0.6})` to `rgba(255, 100, 100, ${snowflake.opacity * 0.6})` for the mid-stop color. Update line 89 from `rgba(240, 245, 255, 0)` to `rgba(255, 100, 100, 0)` for the outer transparent color. Do not modify any other animation logic, particle properties, accessibility features, or canvas rendering infrastructure."
