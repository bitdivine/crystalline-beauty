# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Change the snowfall effect color from red to blue.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the SnowfallBackground component to render snowflakes in blue tones instead of red by modifying the radial gradient color values

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see snowflakes with a soft blue glow effect instead of the current red glow in the background animation.
