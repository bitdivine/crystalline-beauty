  "constraints": [
    "Do not modify the snowfall animation logic, particle density, speed ranges (0.25-1 px/frame), or accessibility features (prefers-reduced-motion support)",
    "Do not change the SnowfallBackground component's canvas rendering infrastructure, devicePixelRatio handling, or resize behavior",
    "Only modify the color values in the drawSnowflake function's gradient creation"

  "nonGoals": [
    "Changing the background component from SnowfallBackground to another animation type",
    "Modifying the snowfall particle count, size ranges, or drift behavior",
    "Adding color customization controls or theme integration",
    "Changing any other visual elements beyond the snowflake color itself"
